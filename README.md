A small program to randomly generate queries over the datasets generated by 
[socialGen](https://github.com/westmann/socialGen).

To build the project, you need to install socialGen to your maven repository first:

    $git clone https://github.com/westmann/socialGen
    $cd socialGen
    $mvn clean install

Then, you can build the query generator:

    $git clone https://github.com/sigmod/query-generator.git
    $cd query-generator
    $mvn clean package

After building the project with `mvn clean package` a package (`*-binary-assembly*`) is available in the `target` directory.
The binary package contains a bash script `qgen.sh` that can be used to generate queries from parameterized queries in
directory "templates".

Run the script without arguments to see the parameters:

    $cd ./target/query-generator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-binary-assembly/
    $bin/qgen.sh

The last command will generate randmized queries in directory "queries".
You can also add an integer parameter to the command:

    $bin/qgen.sh 3

This will generate three test query suites in "queries0", "queries1", and "queries2" respectively.
